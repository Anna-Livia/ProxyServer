How to test the server?
1. Run the server on a terminal. Keep it running and switch to your favorite browser.
2. Go to your browser’s proxy settings and change the proxy server to ‘localhost’ and port to ‘12345’.
3. Now open any HTTP website (not HTTPS), for eg. geeksforgeeks.org and volla !! you should be able to access the content on the browser.
